First HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project attempted.

Learned about the basics of working with a code editor, in order to build a functioning desktop website consisting of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first project-based learning pursuit that led me to dive headfirst into JavaScript forms and working with arrays, as well as an introduction to assigning query selectors to variables. Also introduced to form validation.

Gained familiarity with vanilla CSS topics such as spacing, colors, displays, and transitions.
